# lyft-interview-test

Hello, I would like to inform that I have completed this small web application using Nodejs. Please start server on port 3000.
Please find attached API-Postman-IMG image which describes that POST request to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut” to server and return a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string.
